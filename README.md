Currently, my main project is a general use, multi-purpose bot for Discord, covering areas such as Moderation, Stats Tracking, and others.  
This is under a private repo, so I dont think it is being counted in the stats board above.  
As of September 2021, the project has over 5000 lines of code, mostly in JavaScript (predominantly Node.js), but also partly in HTML (EJS) and CSS  
  
I am most proficient with JavaScript, because of this project, but I also have used Python and C#, as well as HTML and CSS    
  
If you would like to reach me, the fastest response will be on discord.  
You can find me as the owner of [the Bot's support server](https://discord.gg/fUUutjXXgS), alternatively, you can try to find me directly, my username (correct as of the most recent commit) is `@Coob#7869` and my ID is `254360775903150083`
